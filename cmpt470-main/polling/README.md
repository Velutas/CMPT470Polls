What isn't working:
    - A gravatar user image for users was planned but was not implemented in time.
    - User tiers were planned at one point but scrapped later on in development.
    - In general, the system was not extensively tested. Developers made efforts to keep code secure but things were not stress tested.
Feature list:
    - Private messaging has been implemented.
    - A notification system for messages and friend requests has been implemented.
    - Every time the system detects a user has matched 5 answers with another user, it sends a notification prompting them to connect.
    - Tag based searching, as well as filtering for polls has been implemented.
    - Users can set privacy levels for their response feed and contact list.
    - Mods or admins can delete polls and comments.
    - Admins can change user types (normal, admin, moderator). However, Admins cannot change eachother's types.
Userids to explore the system:
    Admin account
    email: kstory@sfu.ca
    password: cmpt470pw
    
    Moderator account
    email: kenstoryx@gmail.com

    - Additional accounts can be created, and account emails can be changed in the options section.
    - You can create your own account. Mailing has been integrated into the system for account activation and password resets, sent from cmpt470g15@gmail.com
